          <p>I smell old people! Oh, wait no that's just you üòÇ. Happy 20th Birthday, my baby! üéâ‚ú®</p>
          <p>
            I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre already turning 20! It feels like such a big step, and I‚Äôm so grateful to 
            be here, sharing this moment with you. It honestly feels like just yesterday we were laughing, 
            staying up late talking, playing ping pong, going to class together, eating, and making memories. 
            Seeing you grow into the person you are today has been one of the most special things in my life‚ù§Ô∏è. 
            Your strength, kindness, and resilience never fail to amaze me since we first met in KMB. I admire 
            you more than I can ever put into words. From day one, you've shown such courage, fighting through 
            your eczema, the wound on your knee, and so much more. üíã You‚Äôve never failed to make me proud!

            Thank you for sticking by my side, through everything. For your patience, for your love, 
            and for always supporting me. I know I‚Äôm not the easiest person sometimes, and I‚Äôve let you 
            down more times than I‚Äôd like to admit. I‚Äôm really sorry for the times I wasn‚Äôt there for you 
            the way you deserved, and it honestly weighs on me üôÉüôè. But I want you to know I‚Äôm trying to 
            be better, to be the person you can always count on. You deserve nothing less.

            I wish I could‚Äôve planned something more special for you today. I know you love surprises and 
            little gestures, and I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt manage to pull off something amazing this time ü•≤. 
            But even without a grand plan, I want you to know that you‚Äôre always on my mind ü•∞. 
            I‚Äôm constantly thinking about how to show you just how much you mean to me, and I promise, 
            we‚Äôll make up for this soon in a way that‚Äôll remind you how important you are to me, my love üíï.

            Today is all about YOU. Your 20th birthday marks a new chapter in your life, and I hope 
            it‚Äôs filled with all the happiness and love you deserve. You‚Äôve accomplished so much already, 
            and I know this is just the beginning. You‚Äôve got so much talent(guitar, drums, making those 
            "not-so-funny" jokes üòú), and so many dreams, and I can‚Äôt wait to see where life takes you next. 
            No matter what, I‚Äôll always be cheering you on even if we are not as close  one day üòä.

            Thank you for everything that you have done for me, your love, your friendship, your patient, every
            moment we‚Äôve shared, whether they were happy or tough. Every second with you has been a gift, and 
            I don‚Äôt take it for granted. I love you more than I could ever explain, and I‚Äôm so lucky to have you 
            in my life. You bring so much warmth and joy into my world, and I honestly can‚Äôt imagine it without you.

            I know I‚Äôve made mistakes, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll make more along the way, but I need you to know that I‚Äôm 
            always here for you. I‚Äôm always trying to be better, to be more present, and to show you how much you 
            mean to me. You deserve the absolute best in life, and I‚Äôll never stop trying to give you that, even 
            in the small things üòÖ.

            Saya doakan awak panjang umur and urusan awak sentiasa dipermudahkan and dirahmati Allah. Always be 
            positive no matter what happens. Im so proud of you in whatever you do cus you are you. Good luck in 
            your study, computer science especially in architecture tu üòáüòé. I know you are going to slay, as always! 
            So just keep being your brilliant self, and I‚Äôm sure you will shine brighter than ever, my baby ü•∞. 
            I hope our friendship will not end here. You have always been there in my hard times and my heartbreaks. 
            I thank god everyday for blessing me with such a true friend like you!üíìüíìüíì Jaga solat, be a good person, 
            take a good care of your family especially your parents, and always appreciate others. Appreciate others 
            even if they do have a small impact on you. Last, keep inspiring others, always say sorry first when fighting. 
            Stay humble. I just want a request from you... Dont forget me okay.

            So here‚Äôs to you, my babygirl, as you step into this new chapter. I hope today is filled with love, joy, and 
            all the blessings you deserve. I‚Äôm sending you all my love today, and every day. I can‚Äôt wait to celebrate 
            with you soon. I love youuu!!!üßö‚Äç‚ôÄ
            
            Happy 20th birthday, love. üíñ
